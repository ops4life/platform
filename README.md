# 🛠️ GitHub Repo Template

Welcome to the Template Repository on GitHub! This repository is designed to serve as a starting point for creating new Git repositories with best practices and configurations already set up. Below is a brief overview of the structure and the purpose of each file and directory in this repository.

## ⚙️ Semantic Commit Messages
This project uses [Semantic Commit Messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to ensure meaningful and consistent commit history. The format is as follows:

```php
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

### Types

- `feat`: A new feature (e.g., `feat: add login functionality`).
- `fix`: A bug fix (e.g., `fix: resolve login button issue`).
- `docs`: Documentation changes (e.g., `docs: update API documentation`).
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.) without changing logic (e.g., `style: fix indentation`).
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature (e.g., `refactor: update user controller structure`).
- `test`: Adding or updating tests (e.g., `test: add unit tests for login service`).
- `chore`: Changes to build process, auxiliary tools, or libraries (e.g., `chore: update dependencies`).

### Scope

Optional: The part of the codebase affected by the change (e.g., `feat(auth): add OAuth support`)

### Subject

A brief description of the change, using the imperative mood (e.g., `fix: resolve issue with user authentication`).

## 🔒 Secret Scanning with Gitleaks

This project uses [Gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) to detect secrets and sensitive information in the codebase. Gitleaks is configured to run both locally via pre-commit hooks and in CI/CD pipelines.

### Local Development

Gitleaks runs automatically as a pre-commit hook. To install the pre-commit hooks:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

To run Gitleaks manually:

```bash
pre-commit run gitleaks --all-files
```

### CI/CD Integration

Gitleaks runs automatically on:
- Pull requests to main/master branch
- Pushes to main/master branch

The workflow will fail if any secrets are detected, helping prevent accidental exposure of sensitive information.

### Configuration

The `.gitleaks.toml` file contains:
- Allowlist patterns for false positives
- Custom scanning rules
- Output configuration

## 🚀 Semantic Release

### How It Works

1. Analyze commits: Semantic Release inspects commit messages to determine the type of changes in the codebase.
2. Generate release version: Based on the commit type, it will automatically bump the version following semantic versioning:
- fix → Patch release (e.g., 1.0.1)
- feat → Minor release (e.g., 1.1.0)
- BREAKING CHANGE → Major release (e.g., 2.0.0)
3. Create release notes: It generates a changelog from the commit messages and includes it in the release.
4. Publish: It automatically publishes the new version to the repository (and any other configured registries, e.g., npm).
